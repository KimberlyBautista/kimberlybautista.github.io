<h3>About</h3>

<p>
	Hello world! <span id="color">I'm Kimberly Bautista!</span> I am first year 
	attending the University of Washington.
</p>

<p> 
	I am an autodidact--I have a constant thirst to learn, improve, and grow. Due to the lack of 
	resources for computer science at my high school, I have managed to be self taught in quite
	a few programming languages. Since the end of junior in high school I have constantly been 
	teaching myself different programming languages.
</p>

<p>
	I love computers, science, and technology; so it is no surprise that I plan to major in 
	computer science. 
</p>

<p>
	Currently I am learning how to program Android apps. Combined with my passion for promoting 
	education, this app will hopefully come in handy for studying for tests or exams. It is 
	still in the process of being developed, but my progress can be checked on my 
	<a href="projects.html">personal projects page</a>.
</p>

<p>
	I also love helping out the community whenever I can, especially when it involves education. 
	I tutor students--both those who are struggling in school, and those coming from low-income 
	families who cannot afford a tutor. I also participate in other community service activities. 
	I have led a food drive with twelve other students for the Monroe Rotary Club, and we have 
	achieved more than 6,000 lbs. in food donations, and over $2,000 in money donations for the 
	Sky Valley Food Bank. While volunteering is one way of serving my community, I also want to 
	combine my passion of tutoring and community service with my love for computer science. I 
	hope that my work will be able to impact and help people in my community someday.
