        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Hello world! I'm Kimberly Bautista! </p>
        <p>I am fresh out of high school, and planning on attending the University of Washington in the fall of 2014. I am autodidact--I have a constant thirst to learn, improve, and grow.</p>
	<p>I love computers, science, and technology; so it is no surprise that I plan to double major in computer science and mechanical engineering. Maybe it was when I first started making HTML profile pages for my neopets account. Maybe it was when my dad took apart my computer and I had to put back together myself; or maybe it simply had me at "Hello World."  I do not know when my love for computer science happened, all I know is that it just did. </p>
	<p>Currently I am learning how to program Android apps. Combined with my passion for promoting education, this app will hopefully come in handy for studying for tests or exams. It is still in the process of being made, but I have learned a lot about not just using XML files, but also using SQL databases. As a personal project of mine, I am also working on making a password protection program using Java. My personal endeavor has led me into the fascinating world of cryptography, modular arithmetic, and RSA encryption.</p>
	<p>I also love helping out the community whenever I can, especially when it involves education. I tutor students--both those who are struggling in school, and those coming from low-income families who cannot afford a tutor. I also participate in other community service activities. I have led a food drive with twelve other students for the Monroe Rotary Club, and we have achieved more than 6,000 lbs. in food donations, and over $2,000 in money donations for the Sky Valley Food Bank. While volunteering is one way of serving my community, I also want to combine my passion of tutoring and community service with my love for computer science. I am hoping that my inventions, apps, etc. will be able to help those in my community someday.</p>
